title: My Journey to RSS 
tags: [RSS, miscellaneous]

I used to found that reading online news is an annoying thing to do for me since you need to filtering information from disruptive advertisements. As an engineering student in the field of ECE, I need to subscribe to some latest news from fields of technology, software programming and hardware. Until one day, I got a chance to learn what is RSS subscription and finally know how useful RSS subscription is. 
Here I am going to share some useful RSS sources that I like and I used. 


# Technology News 

- [Hacker News Daily Feed][hacker-news-link]
- [MIT Technology Review][mit-tech-review-link]
- [Slashdot][slashdot-link]
- [IEEE Spectrum][ieee-spectrum-link]


# Tech Company Blog

# Some Other News and Blog

- [Scientific American][scientific-american-link]
- [The Verge][the-verge-link]
- [Tech Crunch][tech-crunch-link]
- [George Soros][george-soros-link]

# How
If you want to ask which application I use for my RSS subscription, I would recommend you *Feedly*. I found that it is very useful to find a new source to subscribe to Feedly. Your search for sources by name or by topic. Feedly also tells how many people are subscribing a source and how many articles are normally posted from a source per week. However, I found the Feedly application's UX is not straight forward, regardless it's Android version or Mac OS version. Fortunately, provide [a link of applications][feedly-app] which support Feedly.

If you have any recommendation or suggestion, please open an issue under [this repo's Issue page][github-issue]
